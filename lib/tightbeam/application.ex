defmodule Tightbeam.Application do
  @moduledoc """
  The supervision tree — the reliability posture in structure (port spec §
  Process architecture). Ordering is `rest_for_one`: the DB is first and
  everything depends on it, so a DB restart deliberately restarts its
  dependents rather than leaving them holding a dead connection.

  Restart intensities are explicit and deliberate: the root tolerates few
  restarts before escalating; the lane DynamicSupervisor tolerates many
  (individual session lanes are cheap and independent). Adapter processes are
  coordinator-managed (a later child), so their restart/backoff policy lives
  in the coordinator, not here.

  Skeleton note: this IS the production tree, not a prototype. The wire
  (Bandit) and AdapterCoordinator are added as their modules land; the shape
  and ownership do not change.

      #
      #   * the identity refusal raises inside `Gateway.preflight/1`, which is called
      #     BEFORE the try — measured, from this repo's own boot:
      #       (ArgumentError) identity repository is missing required refs: ...
      #         gateway.ex:356: Tightbeam.Gateway.preflight/1
      #         application.ex:28: Tightbeam.Application.start/2
      #   * `Schema.ShapeError` is raised by `Schema.ensure_all/1` inside
      #     `Boot.start_link/1`, a SUPERVISED CHILD. A child's raise never reaches the
      #     caller as an exception; `Supervisor.start_link/2` RETURNS
      #     {:error, {:shutdown, {:failed_to_start_child, Tightbeam.Boot, ...}}}.

  # escalates the failed start into "Kernel pid terminated", an {exit,terminating,...}
  # stacktrace, and an `erl_crash.dump` in the install directory. Measured on shrdlu from
  # the npm tarball with no harness CLI on PATH — the most ordinary first-run state there
  # is ("I installed tightbeam before I installed claude") presented as a kernel panic.
  #
  # So: say the sentence, exit non-zero, write no dump. `System.halt/1` with an integer
  # status does not dump. Nothing has started at this point — preflight refuses before
  # the supervisor exists — so there is nothing to shut down in order.

  # config hook so a unit test could reach the decision without halting the VM. That put

  # release keep booting past a refusal it had just printed — silence wearing a message,
  # arranged for the convenience of a test. The refusal is now proven the only way it

  # but a tester with BOTH CLIs on PATH and ONLY codex onboarded still fell to
  # registry-order claude + claude-sonnet-5 — a dead default whose first turn
  # cannot run (mike repro 2026-08-06, wi_24028d10). Installed is not runnable;
  # installed-AND-onboarded is. Onboarded-ness is read synchronously from disk
  # here (Credentials.kind_at), before the async catalog exists.

  # preference" means, and it now means "the harness you can actually run".
  # With NONE of the installed harnesses onboarded we keep the installed-based
  # fallback so boot does not crash — readiness then reports NOT READY and names
  # the gap rather than this code guessing. With two or more runnable, registry
