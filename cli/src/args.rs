const HELP_TEMPLATE: &str = r#"tightbeam — coordinate with other agent sessions in this org.

Every command is one of the substrate's verbs; you invoke them exactly as the
human operator does. Output is JSON on stdout; a nonzero exit means failure
(the message is on stderr).

IDENTITY (optional inside a session workdir; otherwise required):
  --as <role>          act as a role you currently hold. Use this when YOU (an
                       agent) run the command. The role must be bound to your
                       active session.
                       To reply to [from user:mike], use wake --user mike; to
                       reply to [from agent:notetaker], use wake --role
                       notetaker. [from process:x] cannot be woken.
  --as-user <userId>   act as a human user (e.g. "flynn"). Use this for
                       operator/admin actions or when no agent identity applies.
  --as-process <name>  act as automation (cron, CI, a webhook — e.g.
                       "cron"). Processes may wake, cancel-wake, and file
                       condition facts ONLY — they cannot spawn, retire, or
                       administer.
  Pass at most ONE explicit identity. It is who the call is attributed to, NOT
  the target of the call. With no flag, the CLI walks up from the current
  directory for .tightbeam-session and the gateway derives the identity from
  that session credential.

TARGET (for commands that take one — pass exactly one):
  --session <key>      this exact session incarnation
  --role <name>        the office; falls back to its owner's Main if unstaffed
  --user <id>          that human's Main

COMMANDS:
  wake (--session <key> | --role <name> | --user <id>) --prompt "<text>"
       [--after 30s|5m|2h] [--at <epochMs>]
       [--class fyi|status-query|input-needed|blocker|algedonic]
      Condition wake:
        tightbeam wake (--session <key> | --role <name> | --user <id>)
          --when-fact <kind> [--when-scope <scope>]
          (--fallback-after 30s|5m|2h | --at <epochMs>)
          --prompt "<text>" [--key <idempotencyKey>]
      Send a prompt to the selected target. Immediate = a direct message; with --after or
      --at = a scheduled wake that fires later. A wake ALWAYS carries a prompt —
      there is no content-free ping. This is how you DM or nudge another
      session (or yourself).
      A matching fact or fallback delivers a new notification turn.
      It never resumes or replays prior work. The fact stamp reports why the prompt arrived.
      The accountable agent re-reads durable state and decides the next action.
      The fallback timer detects silence only; it does not select an action.
      --prompt is the caller's explicit instruction override.
      Tightbeam carries it without rewriting it.
      --class says how URGENT this is for the receiver, and you elect it: fyi and
      status-query and input-needed are batched into one digest turn at the
      receiver's next turn boundary (or their class ceiling — 4h, 30m, 30m —
      whichever comes first); blocker delivers immediately; algedonic bypasses
      batching entirely and is for genuine pain only. Without --class the wake
      delivers exactly as it always has. --after/--at is your own delivery
      election and always wins over batching. Every batched digest names the
      rule that produced it, so you can see what held your message.
        tightbeam wake --role reviewer --prompt "review PR 12" --as coder
        tightbeam wake --session agent:coder:app --prompt "check CI" --after 5m --as coder
        tightbeam wake --role owner --when-fact build-finished --when-scope app \
          --fallback-after 2h --prompt "re-read the work and decide" --as-process ci

  condition --kind <kind> [--scope <scope>] [--key <idempotencyKey>]
      File an observable fact. Matching condition wakes receive the fact as a new
      notification turn; they never resume or replay prior work.

  artifact-record --kind <kind> --title <title> --path <originPath>
                  [--description <text>] [--work-item <workItemId>] [--sha256 <hex>]
      Record a deliberate artifact pointer for the calling session.
  artifacts [--work-item <workItemId>] [--session <key>]
      List artifact rows matching every supplied exact filter.

  spawn --display "<name>" [--name <role>] [--archetype <a>]
        [--harness {{HARNESSES_PIPE}}] [--model <model>] [--effort <level>]
        [--context <variant>] [--host <host>] [--key <idempotencyKey>]
      Hire a new session (a worker). --display is its human label; --name
      registers a role bound to the new session — do NOT confuse it with --as,
      which is YOUR identity. --key makes the spawn idempotent
      (same key returns the same session). Omitted fields inherit the
      archetype's defaults.
        tightbeam spawn --display "Reviewer" --name reviewer:x \
          --harness {{EXAMPLE_HARNESS}} --model <catalog-model> --effort <level> \
          --as orchestrator:news
      --host picks a machine WITHIN the archetype's allowed set (see list's
      archetypes/hosts); omitted, the archetype's default placement applies.
      A model is named by FIELDS, never one packed string: --model is the
      model itself, --effort its reasoning level, --context the vendor's
      context-window variant when it offers more than one. All must come from
      list's model catalog — never invent one.

  tune --session <key> (--harness {{HARNESSES_PIPE}} --model <model> |
       --model <model> | --effort <level>)
       [--effort <level>] [--context <variant>]
      Change ONE runtime control on a session that is already running. Model
      identity remains separate fields, exactly as in spawn, and every field is
      answered against that host's catalog — an invented harness or model is
      refused by name, never substituted.
        tightbeam tune --session "agent:coder:x s_1" \
          --harness {{EXAMPLE_HARNESS}} --model <catalog-model> --as orchestrator:news
      --model on its own retunes the model on the RESIDENT harness and the
      engine's conversation survives. --harness changes the engine, so its
      conversation cannot come along: the visible transcript restarts from an
      [engine swap] marker (earlier rows are retained, not deleted) while the
      Tightbeam session, its role, its work, and its graph position stay put.
      Naming the resident harness again is refused — omit --harness for a
      same-harness model change. --harness REQUIRES --model: crossing an
      engine boundary is a model election, and Tightbeam never elects on
      your behalf (omitting it is refused as model_required). The source
      model and its effort tier are never carried across the boundary.
      A switch is YOUR election and lands only at a turn boundary: while the
      session has a running or queued turn the call is refused with
      turn_in_progress and nothing changes. Retry once the turn finishes —
      Tightbeam will not queue the switch behind it, and never re-engines a
      session on its own initiative.

  list
      Show the sessions you can address (with handles + provenance), the
      org's shape — archetypes (with allowed hosts), known hosts, and the
      valid model catalog per harness — and, for admins, pending devices.
        tightbeam list --as orchestrator:news

  retire --session <key> [--key <idempotencyKey>]
      End a session deliberately.

  work-item-create --title "<title>" [--spec-ref <name> --spec-sha256 <hex>]
                   [--key <idempotencyKey>]
      File a work item. Unrouted, it becomes YOUR problem on a deadline: file
      it, then route it (assign/dispatch) or icebox it. --key makes create
      idempotent (same key returns the same item).
  work-item-get <workItemId>
  work-item-trace <workItemId>
  attend [--high]
      Elect the attention tier of the reply you are about to give, during your
      own turn. --high marks it high; without the flag it is normal, which is
      also what electing nothing gives you. Those two, no others: `low` is in
      the same vocabulary but is the substrate's election over its own ambient
      notices, never something a reply asks for.
  transcript (--session <key> | --name <displayName>)
             [--before <messageId> | --after <messageId>] [--limit <n>]
      Read a session's conversation from the substrate's own rows. --name is a
      LOOKUP: it returns candidate sessions to choose from, never content.
      No cursor reads the tail (newest first page, shown oldest-first); page
      back with --before <oldestId> and catch up with --after <newestId>, both
      ids the previous response handed you. --limit defaults to 50, caps at 500.

           [--session <key>] [--tree] [--after <workItemId>] [--limit <n>]
      The work telemetry the substrate already knows: every work item you can
      see, with its assignment/job/attest/turn counts, who holds it, whether
      anything is running, and how long it has been quiet. --tree renders the
      causal forest instead of a flat roster. Parent edges are derived from the
      turn that was RUNNING when each item was created, so they record
      concurrency, not proven causality — every node states its own
      epistemic status (linked, from_turn, no_turn_observed, unrecorded).
      No percentages and no completion estimates: the rows do not support them.
        tightbeam toplines --origin user --state open --as-user flynn
      --after/--limit page the FLAT roster on a stable (createdAt, id) cursor;
      the response carries nextAfter and hasMoreAfter. They bound the RESPONSE,
      not the gateway's work — the reader still computes telemetry over every
      item you can see. They are refused with --tree, because a forest has no
      page boundary that is not also a wrong answer.

  topline (--under <workItemId> [roster filters] | --assignments <id,...>)
      --under walks one item's causal subtree (the anchor plus its visible
      linked descendants). --assignments names an explicit assignment set and
      reports the items they resolve to; an assignment belonging to no item
      comes back in noItem rather than being silently dropped.
        tightbeam topline --under wi_abc123 --as-user flynn
  coordination-share --session <key> --from <epochMs> --to <epochMs>
      What share of a session's turns were spent on coordination traffic over a
      window — every turn a wake materialized, classed or not, except an
      algedonic alarm or a deliberate summon, against all its turns. Counts
      rows and names no threshold; a window with no turns reports a null
      share, not zero.
        tightbeam coordination-share --session agent:po --from 1 --to 2 --as-user flynn
  digest-members <wakeId>
      Every source wake a digest carries, oldest first — the C4/acceptance-2
      audit as a status question, answerable from rows. Refuses by name if
      the id is unknown, is not a digest carrier, or names a carrier you
      cannot see — the same not_found either way.
        tightbeam digest-members w_abc123 --as-user flynn
  work-item-icebox <workItemId>
      Shelve an unstaffed item (open → iceboxed). Requires zero open
      assignments; work-item-reopen resumes it.
  work-item-reopen <workItemId>
  work-item-close <workItemId>
      Conclude an item (→ closed). Requires zero open assignments.
  work-item-fail <workItemId> [--reason <text>]
      Rule an item failed (→ failed); --reason is recorded on the item.
  assign --subject "<work>" (--session <key> | --role <name>)
         [--key <key>] [--work-item <workItemId>]
         [--reviews <assignmentId>] [--effect-kind <kind>]
         [--files '["lib/a.ex","test/a_test.exs"]']
      Open an obligation held by a session; a work item is the durable thread
      across assignments.
  dispatch (--to <sessionKey> | --holder <sessionKey>) --subject "<work>"
           --brief "<one sentence>" [--work-item <workItemId>]
           [--effect-kind <kind>] [--workdir-root <relativePath>] [--key <key>]
      Atomically open an assignment and wake its holder with the card id.
  effort-rule --request <decisionRequestId> --action continue|dismiss
      Rule an effort-without-effect check-in routed to your principal.
  decision-requests [--status open|ruled|all]
      List decision requests visible to your principal.
  ask (--session <key> | --role <name> | --user <id>) --question "<text>"
      [--about <assignmentId>]
      Put one question to another principal and get back its id. THE QUESTION
      HOLDS NOTHING: filing it does not pause your assignment, your turn, or
      anything else — you still owe what you owed, and you choose whether to
      wait for the answer, work something else, or surrender the card. Read the
      answer with decision-requests / decision-request, take the question back
      with withdraw --request <id> --reason "...". The person you asked gets it
      at their next turn boundary, or within 30 minutes, whichever is first.
        tightbeam ask --role owner --question "ship behind a flag or block?" --as coder
  answer --request <decisionRequestId> --answer "<text>"
      Answer a question that was put to you. It is an answer, not a ruling: it
      authorizes nothing and unblocks nothing on its own. Only the principal
      the question was asked of can answer it.
  revoke-assignment <assignmentId>
      Revoke when the assignment handler already authorizes your principal.
  reopen-assignment <assignmentId> --reason "..."
      Move a CLOSED assignment back to open so its holder can file the verdict
      or lifecycle row the card still owes — the agent-reachable repair for a
      card that closed carrying the wrong judgment. The prior close is kept on
      the record. Refuses by name when the card is already open, its holder is
      retired, its work item is not open, or its files collide.
  attest <assignmentId> --kind progress|completion|surrender|verdict
      [--commit-refs '[{"repo":"host:/abs/path","commit":"<commit>"}]']
         [--verdict <kind>] [--note "..."]
      File against an assignment. Verdicts on review cards require the review
      holder; producer-card verdicts may be filed by any session or user.
  attests <assignmentId> [--after <attestId>] [--limit <n>]
      List every attest filed against an assignment. Without --limit you get
      all of them: an audit list that shortens itself silently is worse than a
      long one. --after <attestId> resumes strictly after the attest you name,
      so you can walk a long trail without re-reading it; the response carries
      nextAfter and hasMoreAfter to drive the next call.
        tightbeam attests as_abc --limit 50 --as-user flynn
  assignments [--session <key> | --role <name>] [--state open|closed|all]
      List assignments (open by default).

  cancel-wake <wakeId>
      Cancel a pending (scheduled) wake by its id (from the wake command's
      output).

  kungfu list
      List the kungfu bundles shipped with this Tightbeam build and each
      bundle's declared root archetype.

  ADMIN (require --as-user of an admin, or an admin-owned agent handle):
  identity edit <archetype> [--manifest | --skill <name> [--rm]]
                [--file <path>]
      Edit the served identity. Without --file, content is read from stdin.
  identity relearn [--abort | --resolve]
      Re-import and merge the neutral seed plus every learned kungfu bundle;
      resolve or abort a conflict.
  identity repoint <retired-session> <archetype>
      Repoint a retired session row to an installed archetype.
  learn <bundle>
      Install a shipped kungfu bundle. Available bundles ship with Tightbeam
      under priv/kungfu/; learning an installed bundle is a no-op.
  unlearn <bundle>
      Remove a learned kungfu bundle by its committed receipt.
  identity status [<archetype>]
      Report the live revision, session revisions, staleness, and conflicts.
  identity apply (<session> | --all)
      Refresh selected sessions from the current live identity revision.
  onboard openai|anthropic [--api-key]
      Run this machine's credential onboarding flow. Without --api-key this is
      the interactive subscription ceremony. With it the flow is
      non-interactive and the KEY is read from stdin -- never as an argument,
      which would put a secret in this machine's process table:
        printenv ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | tightbeam onboard anthropic --api-key
      The key is validated against the provider before it is banked, and it
      never leaves this machine.

  add-user <userId> [--admin]
      Add a user, optionally as an admin. An existing admin may run this over
      the ordinary gateway path. On an empty local org, the first user is
      created directly and becomes admin by the existing cold-start rule.
  config get default-archetype                   read the default spawn archetype
  config set default-archetype <name>            set the default spawn archetype
  host-env-set --host <host> --harness <harness> NAME=VALUE
      Set one host- and harness-scoped environment overlay. The result states
      when the adapter will observe the new value.
  host-env-list [--host <host>] [--harness <harness>]
      List environment overlays, optionally filtered by exact host and harness.
  host-env-unset --host <host> --harness <harness> NAME
      Remove one exact environment overlay.
  harness-process list
      List the durable harness launch ledger, newest launch first.

  doctor [--json] [--base-dir p]
      Check the local Tightbeam installation and report its health.

  assimilate <ssh-dest> [--name n] [--base-dir p] [--harness {{HARNESSES_CSV}}]
             [--dry-run]
      Prepare a machine to run agent harnesses and register it as a host
      (admin). Probes ssh, node, npm, rsync and the CLI of every harness
      being enabled, creates the base dir, installs the ACP adapters and
      this CLI, and records the host. --dry-run runs that probe for real
      and writes nothing else.
      HARNESS CLIs ARE YOURS TO INSTALL. Tight Beam installs its own
      plumbing on a satellite — adapters, CLI, base dir — never the
      vendors' software, and --harness <h> means "enable h here", which
      presupposes h's CLI is already there. The probe sees only what a
      non-interactive ssh session sees, so a binary reachable through a
      login shell profile alone does not count. Credentials never
      transit between machines; run `tightbeam onboard` independently on
      the assimilated host.
      After: add the host to an archetype's `where`.
        tightbeam assimilate work-1.local --as-user flynn

DISCOVERY: an explicitly set TIGHTBEAM_BASE_DIR is an isolation boundary and
  uses only <base>/gateway.json. Otherwise, the CLI walks up from cwd for
  .tightbeam-session, then uses TIGHTBEAM_URL + TIGHTBEAM_TOKEN, then
  <TIGHTBEAM_HOME|~/.tightbeam>/gateway.json.

DURATIONS (for --after and --fallback-after): <n>ms | <n>s | <n>m | <n>h
  (e.g. 30s, 5m, 2h).
