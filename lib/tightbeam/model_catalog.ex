defmodule Tightbeam.ModelCatalog do
  @moduledoc """
  Asynchronously derived model inventory, keyed by `{host, harness}`.

  Credentials are host-local by design, so entitlements are host-local, so a
  catalog is a fact about ONE host's account — and about the KIND of credential
  that host holds, since the two kinds read different routes with different
  entitlements. A satellite on an API key and a gateway on a subscription derive
  genuinely different catalogs, and neither is a stale copy of the other. It used to be derived once, on the
  gateway, from the gateway's credential, and then applied to every host — which
  validated a spawn against the gateway account while the turn ran under the
  target host's (#88). Facts about a host are established on that host.

  The keys are `Placement.hosts/1` x `Harness.all/0`, re-enumerated on every
  refresh pass, so a host assimilated after boot gets its entries without a
  restart. Freshness, TTL, and degraded reasons are per entry: an unreachable
  host degrades only its own.

  The server owns only cached data and freshness metadata. Provider I/O always
  runs in separate tasks, so readers return cached (or empty) state immediately.
