# ExUnit's default assert_receive budget is 100ms, and nobody chose it. Several
# acp_adapter tests wait on a message that can only arrive after a real `node`
# ACP stub has booted and completed a handshake, and node's cold start alone eats
# most of 100ms on a loaded macOS runner: two of three macOS CI samples failed a
# DIFFERENT subset of that one module (4 then 6 tests, all "no matching message
# after 100ms" with an empty mailbox), while the same module passes on a quiet dev
# mac and on the linux runner. That is a budget failure, not a defect the suite
# found, and a flaky gate cannot arbitrate platform parity.
#
# This weakens no assertion. Every one of these tests still requires its exact
# message and still fails if it never arrives; the only thing that changes is how
# long a correct message is allowed to take.
#
# refute_receive is the OPPOSITE case and the dangerous one, so read this before
# reaching for it. It fails toward GREEN: a message that should have arrived but
# has merely been delayed past the window is indistinguishable from a message
# that was correctly never sent, so load turns a real defect into a pass. The
# 100ms default was left in place here for a long time with a note calling it
# deliberate, and the census behind #83 found twelve sites relying on it where
# nothing guaranteed the refuted work had even STARTED — the absence being
# asserted was the absence of a beginning.
#
# The floor is deliberately NOT raised, and the reason is worth keeping. It would
# cover scheduler- and mailbox-scale delay, which is not what made those sites
# unsound: the quantities there were process-spawn scale — measured on this
# project, /bin/sh reaching a fork is 235-1668ms and a `node` ACP stub boot is
# worse. A floor that covered THAT would have to be seconds. Meanwhile every
# PASSING refute pays its window in full, so the cost is paid by the healthy
# path at all 34 sites that take the default and none of it is paid by the bug.
#
# So a global floor buys no soundness it can name while charging every site for
# it, and the number would be chosen for no site in particular. If a specific
# refute needs a longer window, measure that site and widen it there.
#
# What actually closes the hole is the barrier. If you are refuting a message,
# first make the racing side signal that it has STARTED, assert_receive that
# signal, and only then refute — or use a barrier the TARGET answers, which for
# a multi-sender race means reading the target's own books rather than trusting
# mailbox order between processes that never exchanged a message.
# test/support/test_case.ex documents the sanctioned ones.
