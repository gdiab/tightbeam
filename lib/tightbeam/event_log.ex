defmodule Tightbeam.EventLog do
  @moduledoc """
  Append-only observability (T5): verb events, lifecycle events, and boot
  epochs. Nothing consumes these to make decisions in the core — they exist so
  every failure has a row and a reason, and so future rule reactions have a
  feed. Additive tables only; the shared `events` table (verb|denied) keeps
  its original CHECK — lifecycle records go to their own table.

  Crash recording is BY INFERENCE (spec: lifecycle acceptance): a boot epoch
  with no clean-shutdown stamp is recorded as a dirty exit at the NEXT boot.
  No component claims to log its own death.

  `lifecycle/4` writes a row and stops there, which is right for the events
  nobody needs woken for. An event that HAPPENED TO SOMEONE goes through
  `notice/5` instead: same row, plus the chat marker its audience reads. One
  call owns both halves on purpose — see `notice/5`.
