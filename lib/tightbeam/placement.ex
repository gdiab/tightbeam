defmodule Tightbeam.Placement do
  @moduledoc """
  Placement mechanics (spec §Placement) — the ONE module that knows hosts
  exist. Everything else addresses identity; this module turns a host NAME
  into an adapter command, a delivered shared home, and an allow/deny answer.

  Hosts are DB ROWS behind the org's DB owner — the serialization seam — written
  by `assimilate` through `register_host/3` and read back as name =>
  %{ssh: destination-or-nil, base_dir: path, cli_bin: path-or-nil}
  (host-registry-v1). `gateway.json` stays a FILE — the CLI reads it
  before any DB exists. The gateway's own machine is under its
  REAL hostname (`local_host_name/0`; ssh: nil) — never under an indexical
  like "local", because the org's vocabulary must match the operator's
  ("spawn on eezo" has to resolve on eezo, including on eezo itself). Which
  machine is local is carried by `ssh: nil`, not by a special name. Host
  names are what archetype `where` lists and session rows refer to; the ssh
  destination is how to reach one. WHY a host set contains what it does is
  the operator's statute — nothing here hardcodes a topology.

  Four responsibilities, each a pure-ish function:

  1. `resolve/2` — the CONSTITUTIONAL check (set membership of data against
     data, no rule engine): a spawn/tune host must be a member of the
     archetype's `where` AND a configured host. Nil host resolves to the
     FIRST element of `where` (deterministic; richer choice — least-loaded,
     failover — is a resolver rail, later). Denials return the map Dispatch
     expects (%{code: ...}), citing what was denied and the allowed set, so
     agents learn the law by hitting it.

  2. `adapter_opts/2` — build the Acp.Adapter start opts for an adapter key
     {harness, "shared", host}:
     - local: exactly the previous behavior (local binary path, local home
       from Homes.project, env in the local Port).
     - remote: cmd is SSH-WRAPPED — ["ssh", dest, "exec", "env", "K=V"...,
       binary] — because a remote process ignores the local Port env, ALL
       agent env (harness home var, TIGHTBEAM_URL, PATH with the
       remote cli_bin) is embedded in the remote command line. The home var
       points at the REMOTE home path (remote base_dir). stderr_path stays
       LOCAL and unchanged: the Conn's `sh -c '... 2>>log'` wraps the ssh
       client, so remote stderr rides the ssh connection into the local log.
       The advertised URL (config :tightbeam, :advertised_url) is used for
       TIGHTBEAM_URL — never 127.0.0.1 — so the session-file-aware CLI reaches
       the gateway over the network; the org token is never placed in remote env.

  3. `deliver_home/3` — materialize the generic `{harness, machine}` home on
     the session's host. Regeneration owns only the credential entry, rails
     artifact, and `.tightbeam/`; every other harness-owned byte survives.
     Remote regeneration follows the same stop, harvest, replace, and relink
     order without ever deleting the home. Credentials remain host-local.

     `materialize_identity/4` separately projects elected skills into the
     exact session cwd and writes the reserved git exclusion only when that
     cwd is itself a repository checkout.
     Shell execution goes through an injectable runner (`:sh` opt, default
     System.cmd) so tests capture command lines instead of running ssh —
     same pattern as ConnRegistry's injected deliver.

  4. `move_workdir/4` — carry a session's durable scratch when placement
     changes. Local copies use File.cp_r!; remote legs use gateway-originated
     rsync, and remote→remote stages through the gateway because rsync's
     source-host hop is unsupported. Missing source means a fresh session;
     every other failure is returned so the caller can refuse the host write
     rather than silently strand memory.

  Failure posture: deliver_home raising fails the adapter start, which the
  AdapterCoordinator already treats as a failed start (backoff, circuit) —
  an unreachable host degrades exactly like a dead adapter, per spec.
