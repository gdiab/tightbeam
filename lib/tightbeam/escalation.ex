  # THE MAXIM: an agent files a question, and keeps its obligation while it

  # substrate enforces (adjudication-deletion amendment, 2026-08-12).
  #
  # WHAT THIS IS NOT, stated where the code is so a future reader trips over it:
  # nothing in the tree may READ an open `kind = 'agent'` row and act on its
  # existence. Not a completion check, not a turn-end sweep, not an assignment
  # close, not a wake gate. The moment one does, adjudication has been rebuilt
  # with a friendlier face (fabric §10) and this seam is void. Two things hold
  # that down mechanically rather than by promise: the arm above pins every
  # column a gate would need (`parkWakeId`, `rulingFactId`, `decision`) to NULL,
  # and `coordination_fabric_test.exs` scans production for readers of this kind.
  #
  # THE ASKER'S EXITS, all three reachable by the asker alone and none of them
  # anyone else's decision (gate Q3): read the answer when one lands, `withdraw`
  # the question, or simply carry on — the request holds nothing. If the asker
  # sits idle instead, the effort-without-effect rail notices, which is the
  # system working as designed.

  ONE COMMIT: the row and the notification that carries it land together or not

  ## EXTERNAL READERS (Sol xhigh review round 2, finding 1).
  #
  # Every production module outside this file that touches `decision_requests`
  # calls ONE of the functions below — never SQL of its own. That is now the
  # WHOLE of the tripwire's structural half: `coordination_fabric_test.exs`
  # asserts (a) no `decision_requests` literal exists anywhere else in `lib/`,
  # which a text scan can prove exhaustively once there is nowhere else for one
  # to hide, and (b) the function names below, paired with the kind each is
  # scoped to, equal a pinned inventory — so a new helper, or a scope that
  # silently widens, fails the test until it is reviewed and the inventory
  # updated by hand.
  #
  # A prior version of this tripwire DECLARED this inventory by hand and
  # scanned production source for the raw SQL outside it. Sol xhigh review
  # round 3 named four bypasses that survives: a new reader added INSIDE this
  # file with no map entry; a helper removed with its entry left stale; a
  # helper's SQL widened past its declared scope with no textual signal; and
  # a new external caller of an "any"-scoped helper, which has no literal for
  # any scan to catch. `coordination_fabric_test.exs`'s tripwire now closes
  # all four by DERIVING this map from source rather than trusting it:
  #
  #   (a) every function in this file is enumerated, its OWN text extracted
  #       by true `end`-boundary (not "until the next `def`", which bleeds a
  #       neighbor's `@doc` in) with comments stripped, and the set of ones
  #       whose text names `decision_requests` — closed transitively over
  #       LOCAL calls, so a delegate with no SQL of its own (`answer/2`
  #       calling `get_raw/2`) still counts — is asserted equal to this map's
  #       keys.
  #   (b) every entry scoped to one kind (or a named pair) must contain ITS
  #       OWN predicate in its own text.
  #   (c) every "any"-scoped, non-verb helper's external call sites are
  #       pinned by {file, enclosing function}.
  #
  # So this map is now a CHECKED CLAIM, not a fact anyone has to remember to
  # keep current — the derivation is the enumeration, not an approximation of
  # it. It include this module's PRIVATE plumbing too (`get_raw/2`,
  # `current_request/4`, `rule_open/6`, ...): they can never be called from
  # outside (Elixir enforces that), but they are still part of what "every
  # reader lives in escalation.ex" has to mean.
