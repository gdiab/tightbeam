//! The single resolver for `base_dir` in the CLI — where the org lives.
//!
//! This is the Rust half of `Tightbeam.BaseDir`, and it must stay behaviourally
//! identical to it. The gateway WRITES `gateway.json` into the base dir it
//! resolved; the CLI READS it from the base dir it resolves. If the two disagree,
//! the CLI talks to a gateway the operator did not install — or to none at all.
//!
//! They did disagree. `Tightbeam.BaseDir` unified four Elixir resolvers on
//! 2026-07-27 and stopped there, because its invariant test scans `lib/` and the
//! CLI is structurally outside its reach. There were three more here, all of them
//! reading `TIGHTBEAM_HOME` and none of them reading `TIGHTBEAM_BASE_DIR` at all:
//!
//!   * `dispatch::gateway_config_path` — endpoint discovery
//!   * `probe::resolve_base_dir` — `tightbeam doctor` / containment census
//!   * `harnesses::home_dir` — the harness projection cache
//!
//! So with `TIGHTBEAM_BASE_DIR` set — which is what the README documents, and
//! what the systemd unit and LaunchDaemon in it both set — the CLI read
//! `~/.tightbeam/gateway.json`: not its own gateway, but whatever unrelated org
//! happened to live at the default path. Found on shrdlu, 2026-07-27, by the
//! production-install smoke: `tightbeam onboard anthropic` dialled port 4321 from
//! a pre-existing org while its own gateway was serving on 11373. Nothing was
//! listening there, so it failed loudly by luck; had that org been up, onboarding
//! would have banked a credential into a stranger's org and reported success.
//!
//! Precedence, matching `Tightbeam.BaseDir` exactly:
//!
//!   1. `TIGHTBEAM_BASE_DIR`
//!   2. `TIGHTBEAM_HOME`
//!   3. `<home>/.tightbeam`
//!
//! A variable that is SET BUT EMPTY wins and resolves to an empty path, which is
//! Elixir's behaviour (`System.get_env/1` returns `""`, and `"" || x` is `""`) and
//! was already `dispatch`'s. Treating empty as unset would be a third rule, and a
//! rule the gateway does not share is the whole defect being fixed here.
