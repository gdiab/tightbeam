const HELP_TEMPLATE: &str = r#"tightbeam — coordinate with other agent sessions in this org.

Every command is one of the substrate's verbs; you invoke them exactly as the
human operator does. Output is JSON on stdout; a nonzero exit means failure
(the message is on stderr).

IDENTITY (optional inside a session workdir; otherwise required):
  --as <role>          act as a role you currently hold. Use this when YOU (an
                       agent) run the command. The role must be bound to your
                       active session.
                       To reply to [from user:mike], use wake --user mike; to
                       reply to [from agent:notetaker], use wake --role
                       notetaker. [from process:x] cannot be woken.
  --as-user <userId>   act as a human user (e.g. "flynn"). Use this for
                       operator/admin actions or when no agent identity applies.
  --as-process <name>  act as automation (cron, CI, a webhook — e.g.
                       "cron"). Processes may wake, cancel-wake, and file
                       condition facts ONLY — they cannot spawn, retire, or
                       administer.
  Pass at most ONE explicit identity. It is who the call is attributed to, NOT
  the target of the call. With no flag, the CLI walks up from the current
  directory for .tightbeam-session and the gateway derives the identity from
  that session credential.

TARGET (for commands that take one — pass exactly one):
  --session <key>      this exact session incarnation
  --role <name>        the office; falls back to its owner's Main if unstaffed
  --user <id>          that human's Main

COMMANDS:
  wake (--session <key> | --role <name> | --user <id>) --prompt "<text>"
       [--after 30s|5m|2h] [--at <epochMs>]
      Condition wake:
        tightbeam wake (--session <key> | --role <name> | --user <id>)
          --when-fact <kind> [--when-scope <scope>]
          (--fallback-after 30s|5m|2h | --at <epochMs>)
          --prompt "<text>" [--key <idempotencyKey>]
      Send a prompt to the selected target. Immediate = a direct message; with --after or
      --at = a scheduled wake that fires later. A wake ALWAYS carries a prompt —
      there is no content-free ping. This is how you DM or nudge another
      session (or yourself).
      A matching fact or fallback delivers a new notification turn.
      It never resumes or replays prior work. The fact stamp reports why the prompt arrived.
      The accountable agent re-reads durable state and decides the next action.
      The fallback timer detects silence only; it does not select an action.
      --prompt is the caller's explicit instruction override.
      Tightbeam carries it without rewriting it.
        tightbeam wake --role reviewer --prompt "review PR 12" --as coder
        tightbeam wake --session agent:coder:app --prompt "check CI" --after 5m --as coder
        tightbeam wake --role owner --when-fact build-finished --when-scope app \
          --fallback-after 2h --prompt "re-read the work and decide" --as-process ci

  condition --kind <kind> [--scope <scope>] [--key <idempotencyKey>]
      File an observable fact. Matching condition wakes receive the fact as a new
      notification turn; they never resume or replay prior work.

  artifact-record --kind <kind> --title <title> --path <originPath>
                  [--description <text>] [--work-item <workItemId>] [--sha256 <hex>]
      Record a deliberate artifact pointer for the calling session.
  artifacts [--work-item <workItemId>] [--session <key>]
      List artifact rows matching every supplied exact filter.

  spawn --display "<name>" [--name <role>] [--archetype <a>]
        [--harness {{HARNESSES_PIPE}}] [--model <model>] [--effort <level>]
        [--context <variant>] [--host <host>] [--key <idempotencyKey>]
      Hire a new session (a worker). --display is its human label; --name
      registers a role bound to the new session — do NOT confuse it with --as,
      which is YOUR identity. --key makes the spawn idempotent
      (same key returns the same session). Omitted fields inherit the
      archetype's defaults.
        tightbeam spawn --display "Reviewer" --name reviewer:x \
          --harness {{EXAMPLE_HARNESS}} --model <catalog-model> --effort <level> \
          --as orchestrator:news
      --host picks a machine WITHIN the archetype's allowed set (see list's
      archetypes/hosts); omitted, the archetype's default placement applies.
      A model is named by FIELDS, never one packed string: --model is the
      model itself, --effort its reasoning level, --context the vendor's
      context-window variant when it offers more than one. All must come from
      list's model catalog — never invent one.

  list
      Show the sessions you can address (with handles + provenance), the
      org's shape — archetypes (with allowed hosts), known hosts, and the
      valid model catalog per harness — and, for admins, pending devices.
        tightbeam list --as orchestrator:news

  retire --session <key> [--key <idempotencyKey>]
      End a session deliberately.

  tune --session <key> (--harness <harness> --model <model> |
       --model <model> | --effort <level> | --fast on|off)
       [--effort <level>] [--context <variant>]
      Change one runtime control on an existing session. Model identity remains
      separate fields. Same-harness model, effort, and Fast changes preserve the
      engine conversation; a harness change starts a fresh engine context while
      keeping the Tightbeam session, role, work, and graph position. Fast is
      ephemeral and uses only the resident adapter's live advertised option;
      unsupported sessions refuse it. Naming the resident harness again is a
      refusal: omit --harness for a same-harness model change.

  work-item-create --title "<title>" [--spec-ref <name> --spec-sha256 <hex>]
                   [--key <idempotencyKey>]
      File a work item. Unrouted, it becomes YOUR problem on a deadline: file
      it, then route it (assign/dispatch) or icebox it. --key makes create
      idempotent (same key returns the same item).
  work-item-get <workItemId>
  work-item-trace <workItemId>
  attend [--high]
      Elect the attention tier of the reply you are about to give, during your
      own turn. --high marks it high; without the flag it is normal, which is
      also what electing nothing gives you. Those two, no others: `low` is in
      the same vocabulary but is the substrate's election over its own ambient
      notices, never something a reply asks for.
  transcript (--session <key> | --name <displayName>)
             [--before <messageId> | --after <messageId>] [--limit <n>]
      Read a session's conversation from the substrate's own rows. --name is a
      LOOKUP: it returns candidate sessions to choose from, never content.
      No cursor reads the tail (newest first page, shown oldest-first); page
      back with --before <oldestId> and catch up with --after <newestId>, both
      ids the previous response handed you. --limit defaults to 50, caps at 500.
  toplines [--origin user|session|all] [--owner <userId>] [--state <state>]
           [--quiet-over <duration>] [--spec <name> [--spec-sha <sha>]]
           [--session <key>] [--tree]
      The work telemetry the substrate already knows: every work item you can
      see, with its assignment/job/attest/turn counts, who holds it, whether
      anything is running, and how long it has been quiet. --tree renders the
      causal forest instead of a flat roster. Parent edges are derived from the
      turn that was RUNNING when each item was created, so they record
      concurrency, not proven causality — every node states its own
      epistemic status (linked, from_turn, no_turn_observed, unrecorded).
      No percentages and no completion estimates: the rows do not support them.
        tightbeam toplines --origin user --state open --as-user flynn
        tightbeam toplines --quiet-over 2h --as-user flynn
  topline (--under <workItemId> [roster filters] | --assignments <id,...>)
      --under walks one item's causal subtree (the anchor plus its visible
      linked descendants). --assignments names an explicit assignment set and
      reports the items they resolve to; an assignment belonging to no item
      comes back in noItem rather than being silently dropped.
        tightbeam topline --under wi_abc123 --as-user flynn
  work-item-icebox <workItemId>
      Shelve an unstaffed item (open → iceboxed). Requires zero open
      assignments; work-item-reopen resumes it.
  work-item-reopen <workItemId>
  work-item-close <workItemId>
      Conclude an item (→ closed). Requires zero open assignments.
  work-item-fail <workItemId> [--reason <text>]
      Rule an item failed (→ failed); --reason is recorded on the item.
  assign --subject "<work>" (--session <key> | --role <name>)
         [--key <key>] [--work-item <workItemId>]
         [--reviews <assignmentId>] [--effect-kind <kind>]
         [--files '["lib/a.ex","test/a_test.exs"]']
      Open an obligation held by a session; a work item is the durable thread
      across assignments. --files is an advisory suggestion that others can see;
      it reserves no path and does not limit the assignment's work.
  dispatch (--to <sessionKey> | --holder <sessionKey>) --subject "<work>"
           --brief "<one sentence>" [--work-item <workItemId>]
           [--effect-kind <kind>] [--workdir-root <relativePath>] [--key <key>]
      Atomically open an assignment and wake its holder with the card id.
  effort-rule --request <decisionRequestId> --action continue|dismiss
      Rule an effort-without-effect check-in routed to your principal.
  operator-ask --question <q> [--note <t>] [--options a,b,c]
               [--assignment <asgId>] [--deadline <dur>] [--supersedes <dr_id>]
      File an owner-scoped operator decision request.
  operator-rule <dr_id> (--decision <label> | --response <text>)
                [--rationale <text>]
      Record the operator's resolution. Main and presenting proxies never run this command.
  operator-withdraw <dr_id> --reason <text>
      Withdraw an operator decision request as its owner or original asker.
  decision-requests [--status open|ruled|consumed|withdrawn|superseded|all]
      List decision requests visible to your principal.
  revoke-assignment <assignmentId>
      Revoke when the assignment handler already authorizes your principal.

         [--verdict <kind>] [--note "..."]
      File against an assignment. Verdicts on review cards require the review
      holder; producer-card verdicts may be filed by any session or user.
  attests <assignmentId>
      List every attest filed against an assignment.
  assignments [--session <key> | --role <name>] [--state open|closed|all]
      List assignments (open by default).

  cancel-wake <wakeId>
      Cancel a pending (scheduled) wake by its id (from the wake command's
      output).

  kungfu list
      List the kungfu bundles shipped with this Tightbeam build and each
      bundle's declared root archetype.

  ADMIN (require --as-user of an admin, or an admin-owned agent handle):
  identity edit <archetype> [--manifest | --skill <name> [--rm]]
                [--file <path>]
      Edit the served identity. Without --file, content is read from stdin.
  identity relearn [--abort | --resolve]
      Re-import and merge the neutral seed plus every learned kungfu bundle;
      resolve or abort a conflict.
  identity repoint <retired-session> <archetype>
      Repoint a retired session row to an installed archetype.
  learn <bundle>
      Install a shipped kungfu bundle. Available bundles ship with Tightbeam
      under priv/kungfu/; learning an installed bundle is a no-op.
  unlearn <bundle>
      Remove a learned kungfu bundle by its committed receipt.
  identity status [<archetype>]
      Report the live revision, session revisions, staleness, and conflicts.
  identity apply (<session> | --all)
      Refresh selected sessions from the current live identity revision.
  onboard openai|anthropic [--api-key]
      Run this machine's model-provider credential onboarding flow. Without
      --api-key this is the interactive subscription ceremony. With it the flow is
      non-interactive and the KEY is read from stdin -- never as an argument,
      which would put a secret in this machine's process table:
        printenv ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | tightbeam onboard anthropic --api-key
      The key is validated against the provider before it is banked, and it
      never leaves this machine.
  onboard cursor --api-key
      Cursor is API-key only; --api-key is required (no subscription login).
      The KEY is read from stdin -- never as an argument:
        printenv CURSOR_API_KEY | tightbeam onboard cursor --api-key
      The key is validated against the provider before it is banked, and it
      never leaves this machine.
  onboard github [--hostname github.com] [--remote URL]
      Prove or create this host's GitHub CLI browser/device login, then stamp
      non-secret capability metadata. The credential is banked file-backed
      (0600) in Tightbeam's own gh config dir and agents reach it via
      GH_CONFIG_DIR, because daemon-descended agent environments cannot read
      the OS login keychain. With --remote, also prove git can read that
      repository. This never asks an agent for a PAT.

  add-user <userId> [--admin]
      Add a user, optionally as an admin. An existing admin may run this over
      the ordinary gateway path. On an empty local org, the first user is
      created directly and becomes admin by the existing cold-start rule.
  config get default-archetype                   read the default spawn archetype
  config set default-archetype <name>            set the default spawn archetype
  host-env-set --host <host> --harness <harness> NAME=VALUE
      Set one host- and harness-scoped environment overlay. The result states
      when the adapter will observe the new value.
  host-env-list [--host <host>] [--harness <harness>]
      List environment overlays, optionally filtered by exact host and harness.
  host-env-unset --host <host> --harness <harness> NAME
      Remove one exact environment overlay.
  host-toolchain-set --host <host> --dirs '<json-array>'
      Replace the host's ordered toolchain directories. An empty array restores
      the inherited PATH. The result previews the PATH shape adapters will use.
  harness-process list
      List the durable harness launch ledger, newest launch first.

  doctor [--json] [--base-dir p]
      Check the local Tightbeam installation and report its health.

  assimilate <ssh-dest> [--name n] [--base-dir p] [--harness {{HARNESSES_CSV}}]
             [--dry-run]
      Prepare a machine to run agent harnesses and register it as a host
      (admin). Probes ssh, node, npm, rsync and the CLI of every harness
      being enabled, creates the base dir, installs the ACP adapters and
      this CLI, and records the host. --dry-run runs that probe for real
      and writes nothing else.
      HARNESS CLIs ARE YOURS TO INSTALL. Tight Beam installs its own
      plumbing on a satellite — adapters, CLI, base dir — never the
      vendors' software, and --harness <h> means "enable h here", which
      presupposes h's CLI is already there. The probe sees only what a
      non-interactive ssh session sees, so a binary reachable through a
      login shell profile alone does not count. Credentials never
      transit between machines; run `tightbeam onboard` independently on
      the assimilated host.
      After: add the host to an archetype's `where`.
        tightbeam assimilate work-1.local --as-user flynn

DISCOVERY: the CLI walks up from cwd for .tightbeam-session first, then uses
  TIGHTBEAM_URL + TIGHTBEAM_TOKEN, then
  <TIGHTBEAM_BASE_DIR|TIGHTBEAM_HOME|~/.tightbeam>/gateway.json.

DURATIONS (for --after and --fallback-after): <n>ms | <n>s | <n>m | <n>h
  (e.g. 30s, 5m, 2h).

  tightbeam help | --help | -h   show this text.
