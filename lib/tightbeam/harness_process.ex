  Durable identity and lifecycle for OS harness processes.

  A launch writes its row before opening the process. A small POSIX launcher
  creates a new session, records its leader PID, process-group ID, boot marker,
  and per-launch token, then execs the harness. Parking authorizes that durable
  identity immediately before signalling the minted group. The row owns the
  identity file until the launch resolves to a terminal state.

  Assert the launched process group holds ZERO TCP LISTEN sockets (rails-critical launch
  invariant 3), for a harness in the `:shim` class (`Harness.requires_zero_listeners?/1`).

  Fail-closed: any LISTEN socket in the group, or a probe that cannot conclude, is `{:error, _}`
  and the caller refuses the launch. It samples a SETTLE WINDOW rather than once — captured live,
  `opencode acp` v1.18.18 binds an HTTP server on 127.0.0.1:4096 roughly 0.3–1.1s after spawn (see
  EVIDENCE/RAILS-FINDING-acp-http-listener.md), so a single point-in-time probe races the bind;
  the caller (`Acp.Adapter`) runs this only AFTER `initialize` returns, by which point the harness
  has booted. A running process's sockets are observable only at runtime, so a runtime assert is
  as structural as invariant 3 can be. HONEST RESIDUAL: neither a settle window nor a
  post-initialize probe can catch a listener bound strictly later — that gap is for the go-live
  adjudication. Local host only for now; the remote probe is a tracked follow-on.
