defmodule Tightbeam.Gateway do
  @moduledoc """
  The composition root (TS reference: src/gateway.ts — every verb handler and
  the turn pipeline port from there, behavior-for-behavior). Everything below
  this module is independently tested and knows nothing about the whole; this
  module wires stores, pipeline, wire, and adapters together and NOTHING
  else — no logic of its own beyond assembly and the verb handlers.

  Composition strategy (the Elixir-shape decision — binding): there is no
  object graph. Cross-component references are REGISTERED NAMES
  (Tightbeam.DB, Tightbeam.ConnRegistry, Tightbeam.WakeScheduler,
  Tightbeam.AdapterCoordinator, Tightbeam.LaneManager), so there is no
  startup-order circularity: the verb handler table and the turn runner are
  plain funs built here that call names, and every named process is up before
  Bandit accepts a first connection (children order in `children/1`).

  Children appended to Tightbeam.Application's tree, in order:
  ConnRegistry → WakeScheduler → AdapterSupervisor (DynamicSupervisor) →
  AdapterCoordinator → LaneManager (with the runner built here) → Bandit
  (Wire.Router; port + WS upgrade). All under the SAME rest_for_one root —
  a DB restart still restarts everything that could hold stale state.

  The turn pipeline (runner passed to lanes; gateway.ts `runTurn` +
  fifo wiring, adapted to the Ledger):
  1. Lane claims a turn (Ledger). Turn start already broadcast
     accepted/queued by the post/wake handler; the lane's TurnTask broadcasts
     running + typing(on) + activity(on).
  2. Resolve the session (Org); checkout adapter (AdapterCoordinator) — if
     the session's pointer generation is stale, session/load under the load
     semaphore, appending pointer reason "loaded".
  3. No pointer yet → Adapter.new_session, append pointer "created".
  4. Adapter.prompt; append each distinct ACP assistant message to Projection
     (sender "tightbeam", reply_to the echo) in one transaction, then publish
     each committed row via ConnRegistry in seq order.
  5. Terminal: Ledger.finish CAS in the lane; broadcast terminal
     prompt_turn_state + typing(off) + activity(off). Golden frame order for
     the canonical turn: echo → accepted → running → typing(on) →
     activity(on) → ack → assistant → terminal state → typing(off) →
     activity(off).

  Delivery parity (gateway.ts `deliverPrompt`): a user post and a wake are
  the SAME mechanism — append echo to Projection + enqueue exactly one turn
  (Ledger, in ONE transaction: message+turn commit together), broadcast the
  echo, nudge the lane. Wake delivery passes wake_id so the Ledger's UNIQUE
  dedupes at-least-once firing.

  Verb handlers (all built by `handlers/1`, dispatched via Tightbeam.Dispatch;
  port each from gateway.ts's dispatcher.register blocks, including):
  - post (echo+enqueue; dedupe contract), wake (schedule/cancel/immediate
    fire; a wake MUST carry a prompt), condition (file a literal wake fact),
    spawn (idempotency, headcount cap,
    role-name uniqueness, owner inherited from spawn tree), retire (idempotent,
    owner-only), tune (rename | set_model; live-session apply), cancel,
    inspect (owned sessions + owned pending wakes + admin: pending devices),
    approve-device/deny-device/revoke-device/promote-user (admin-gated via
    the origin's owning USER — user-scoped admin).
  - Caller resolution (gateway.ts `resolveCaller`): "user:x" → x;
    "agent:role" → the active role holder's owner; anything else → unknown_caller.

  # `model`/`context`/`efforts` are the named fields the ruling requires: they
  # are the payload's meaning, and `resolve_selection/3` reads them back.
  #
  # `id`/`ref` is one line of text because the client's decoder has ONE slot for
  # a model's stable identity and must tell two context variants of one family
  # apart. It is this seam's line format and nothing downstream parses it — a
  # value coming back is RESOLVED against the catalog that issued it, never
  # split with a regex. It is spelled the way the vendor spells the model
  # because that is what a human should see in a picker.
  # ASSUMED, and it is the vendor's to keep: a family name contains no literal
  # bracket. The `model` slot's two readings — a family, or a family carrying a
  # context variant — both depend on it. A vendor that broke it would have
  # broken its own identifiers first.

  # The inbound half of `wire_model/1`, and the one place a caller's named
  # fields become an identity.
  #
  # Two steps. RESOLVE: a client sends back the row identity this seam issued,
  # so it is looked up in the catalog that issued it — a lookup cannot invent a
  # context the host does not offer, and cannot mistake one of our effort
  # levels for the vendor's variant. An explicit `context` skips it.
  #
  # THE PROPERTY, because it is what to go looking for elsewhere: this function
  # CANNOT DISTINGUISH A MISS FROM A HIT. Both return fields, and no caller can
  # tell which happened. The disambiguation is downstream, and only there.
  #
  # RESOLUTION IS DELIBERATELY LENIENT: an id it cannot find passes through as
  # if it were a family, and NOTHING here refuses it. That is safe only because
  # resolve-then-validate is ONE PIPELINE — every caller hands the result to
  # `validate_catalog_model/4`, which is where an unknown selection is refused
  # by name against the host's live catalog. The gate lives there, once, at the
  # boundary that knows the host. A future caller that resolves without
  # validating reintroduces silent acceptance of an unknown model.
  #
  # COMPLETE: fields the caller omitted inherit the default, which is what the
  # CLI promises. `--effort high` alone is the default model at high effort,
  # not a flag accepted and dropped. Context and effort belong to a MODEL, so
  # neither carries across a change of model — when the family changes they are
  # left open for `compose_model_selection/4`, the one place that decides which

  #     `effort` that WAS.
  #   - turn provenance (`Toplines.minds/1`, `Transcript`, `JobTrace`) reads
  #     three COLUMNS and never holds a `%Model{}` at all.
  #
  # Both would have to build a struct only to flatten it again. Narrowing the
  # claim costs nothing; leaving it wide invites the next reader to trust it
  # further than it goes.
  #
  # A packed value alone would make a consumer split the string to recover the

  #
  # The guard is the round-trip test in gateway_test.exs, "an issued row

  # lock (see repoint_main_session, the same shape). `ensure_lane_quiet` first so
